# Events Management UI Update - Complete

## Summary
Successfully updated the Events Management UI to use the new database structure with game templates, prize sets, and EventGame junction table.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Prize Sets API** (`/app/api/admin/prize-sets/route.ts`)
   - GET: Returns all prize sets with nested prizes and eventGames
   - POST: Creates new prize set
   - PUT: Updates prize set
   - DELETE: Deletes prize set (cascade deletes prizes)

### 2. **Updated Events Management Page** (`/app/admin/events/page.tsx`)

#### Form Data Structure
- Changed from `games: Game[]` to `eventGames: EventGame[]`
- New structure includes:
  ```typescript
  eventGames: {
    gameId: number
    prizeSetId: number
    customGameName?: string  // Optional override for template name
    displayOrder: number
    game?: Game              // UI helper - full game data
    prizeSet?: PrizeSet      // UI helper - full prize set data with prizes
  }[]
  ```

#### New Handler Functions
- `handleAddEventGame()` - Add a game to the event
- `handleEventGameChange()` - Update game, prize set, or custom name
- `handleRemoveEventGame()` - Remove a game from the event
- `handleMoveEventGame()` - Reorder games with up/down buttons
- Removed old handlers for individual prize management

#### UI Changes
- **Game Selection**: Dropdown shows all game templates (no eventId filter)
- **Custom Name**: Optional input to override the game template name for this event
- **Prize Set Selection**: Dropdown shows all prize sets with prize count
- **Prize Preview**: Shows all prizes in the selected prize set with values
- **Reorder Controls**: Up/down buttons to change game display order
- **Remove Button**: Delete game from event

#### Data Loading
- Added `fetchPrizeSets()` function
- Load prize sets on page mount
- Pass prize set data to form

### 3. **Updated Database Functions** (`/lib/db-functions.ts`)

#### createEvent
- Added `eventGames` parameter to type definition
- Creates EventGame junction entries after event creation
- Links games to events with prize sets and custom names

#### updateEvent  
- Added `eventGames` parameter handling
- Deletes existing EventGame entries
- Creates new EventGame entries from updated data
- Handles both `assignedPonds` and `pondIds` for backwards compatibility

### 4. **Database Permissions**
- Granted ALL PRIVILEGES on all tables to `pond_admin` user
- Granted USAGE, SELECT on all sequences to `pond_admin` user
- Fixed initial permission issue where grants were to wrong user (scwmbp)

### 5. **Prisma Client**
- Regenerated Prisma client to include EventGame model
- Restarted server to pick up new client

## Testing Status

### ✅ Completed
- Prize Sets API endpoint working (`/api/admin/prize-sets`)
- Games API endpoint includes eventGames relation
- Prizes API endpoint includes prizeSet relation
- Events API endpoint includes eventGames with nested game and prizeSet
- Events Management UI loads with new structure
- Form displays existing eventGames correctly
- Can add/remove/reorder games in form

### ⚠️ Needs Testing
- Create new event with multiple games and prize sets
- Edit existing event (Weekend Fishing Championship, New Year Festival)
- Verify data saves correctly to EventGame table
- Verify event display shows custom game names
- Verify prize calculations use correct prize set

## Database Structure Verification

```sql
-- Verify EventGame table exists and has correct data
SELECT eg.*, g.name as game_name, ps.name as prize_set_name 
FROM "EventGame" eg
JOIN "Game" g ON g.id = eg."gameId"
JOIN "PrizeSet" ps ON ps.id = eg."prizeSetId"
ORDER BY eg."eventId", eg."displayOrder";

-- Expected result: 3 rows
-- Event 1 (Weekend Fishing Championship): 2 games
-- Event 2 (New Year Fishing Festival): 1 game
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the UI end-to-end**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/events
   - Try editing "Weekend Fishing Championship"
   - Verify both games and prize sets appear
   - Try adding a third game
   - Try changing prize sets
   - Save and reload to verify persistence

2. **Fix any edge cases**:
   - Handle events with no games
   - Handle empty prize sets
   - Add validation (require at least one game?)
   - Add loading states

3. **Update other related pages**:
   - Games Management (remove event selection)
   - Prize Sets Management (create new page)
   - Event details/view pages

4. **Document new workflow**:
   - How to create game templates
   - How to create prize sets
   - How to assign them to events

## Files Changed

- `/app/admin/events/page.tsx` - Complete UI rewrite for new structure
- `/app/api/admin/prize-sets/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `/lib/db-functions.ts` - Updated createEvent, updateEvent, added prize set functions
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Already updated in previous session
- `/prisma/manual_migration.sql` - Already executed in previous session

## API Endpoints

All endpoints tested and working:

- `GET /api/admin/prize-sets` - Returns 3 prize sets with prizes
- `GET /api/admin/games` - Returns 3 games with eventGames relation
- `GET /api/admin/prizes` - Returns prizes with prizeSet relation
- `GET /api/admin/events` - Returns events with eventGames, games, and prize sets

## Known Issues

None currently. All TypeScript errors resolved, all API endpoints working, UI loads correctly.

## Success Metrics

- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ All API endpoints return 200 OK
- ✅ Prize sets loaded correctly (3 sets)
- ✅ Games loaded as templates (no eventId)
- ✅ Events loaded with eventGames relation
- ✅ UI renders without errors
