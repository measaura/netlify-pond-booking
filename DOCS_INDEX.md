2. **Use WORKFLOWS.md as reference** - Keep it open while testing. The visual diagrams help understand what should happen.

3. **Follow TESTING_GUIDE.md systematically** - Don't skip sections. Each builds on previous ones.

4. **Bookmark SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Great reference for commands and troubleshooting.

5. **Read SESSION_RECAP.md last** - Only needed if you want historical context.
