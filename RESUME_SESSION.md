# Resume instructions for assistant

This file captures the state of the last session and explains how to resume work in a new chat.

Date: 2025-10-15
Branch: main

What was done:
- Fixed import error in `app/manager/monitor/page.tsx` by adjusting client fetch import to a relative path.
- Began replacing `alert()` usages with the project's toast system (`useToastSafe()` + `toast.push(...)`) and falling back to `window.alert()` where needed.
- Files modified so far:
  - `app/manager/monitor/page.tsx` (import fix)
  - `app/ticket/page.tsx` (alert -> toast)
  - `app/booking/[pondId]/page.tsx` (many alert -> toast replacements)
  - `app/admin/control/page.tsx` (alert -> toast replacements)

Pending tasks and recommended next steps:
1. Continue replacing `alert()` occurrences across the repo. Priority files: `app/scanner/page.tsx`, `app/dedicated-scanner/page.tsx`, `app/admin/*` (ponds/events/games/prizes), `app/bookings/*`.
2. After a batch of replacements, run a repo-wide TypeScript typecheck and `npm run lint`.
3. Smoke-test critical flows (booking creation, scanner check-in/out, admin control actions) to ensure toasts show and behavior is correct.

How to resume in a new chat:
- Open this repository in the workspace.
- Read `RESUME_SESSION.md` for context.
- The user will type the single word `resume` in the new chat. The next assistant should:
  1. Read this `RESUME_SESSION.md` file.
  2. Read the todo list at the top-level of the project or ask to view it; the file `TODO` is not present but this repo uses the assistant-managed todo list.
  3. Pick up with Todo #2: "Replace alert() usages" â€” mark it `in-progress` and continue editing files.

Notes:
- Use `useToastSafe()` from `components/ui/toast.tsx` and follow the existing pattern used in modified files: `const toast = useToastSafe(); toast ? toast.push({ message, variant }) : window.alert(message)`.
- Keep edits minimal and run file-level typechecks when possible. After a batch, run global checks.

Contact:
- The user prefers the assistant to continue automatically; if uncertain about priorities, ask the user to confirm whether to prioritize admin/scanner pages or run a repo-wide replace first.
