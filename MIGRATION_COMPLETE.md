## Breaking Changes üî•

The following need to be updated:

### APIs to Update:
- ‚úÖ `/api/admin/games` - Now returns games without eventId
- ‚úÖ `/api/admin/prizes` - Now returns prizes with prizeSetId
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `/api/admin/prize-sets` - NEW endpoint needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `/api/admin/events` - Must use EventGame junction for games

### Database Functions to Update:
- `getEvents()` - Must include `eventGames` with nested `game` and `prizeSet`
- `getGames()` - Now returns templates (no eventId filter needed)
- `getPrizes()` - Now filtered by prizeSetId
- NEW: `getPrizeSets()`, `createPrizeSet()`, etc.

### UI Components to Update:
- Games Management - Remove event selection (standalone templates)
- Prize Management - Replace with Prize Sets Management

## Next Steps

1. **Update API endpoints** - Make them work with new structure
2. **Update database functions** - Handle new relationships
3. **Update UI components** - Reflect new workflow
4. **Add Special Prizes** - Grand Prize & Lucky Draw features
