## ✅ CONFIRMED: No Multi-Language Support in Original

### Search Results
- ✅ Searched original repository for i18n/intl dependencies: **NONE FOUND**
- ✅ Checked package.json: **No translation libraries**
- ✅ Only Next.js built-in locale files exist (in node_modules)
- ✅ All UI text hardcoded in English

### Conclusion
**Multi-language support does NOT exist in the original repository.** This was a misunderstanding or feature request for the future, not an existing capability.

  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  description String
  icon        String
  category    String   // milestone, skill, loyalty, competitive, dedication
  criteria    Json     // Achievement unlock criteria
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  userAchievements UserAchievement[]
}

model UserAchievement {
  id            Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId        Int
  achievementId Int
  earnedAt      DateTime    @default(now())
  
  user          User        @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  achievement   Achievement @relation(fields: [achievementId], references: [id])
  
  @@unique([userId, achievementId])
