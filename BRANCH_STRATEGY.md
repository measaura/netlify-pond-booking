# 🌿 Branch Strategy - Reference Branches

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Strategy:** Option C - Keep as Reference Branches  
**Status:** Active Reference Branches

---

## 📋 Overview

This repository maintains **organized reference branches** for different feature sets and documentation. These branches are kept separate from `main` to allow selective integration when needed.

### Why Reference Branches?

✅ **Clean main branch** - Production-ready code only  
✅ **Selective integration** - Cherry-pick specific features when needed  
✅ **Clear organization** - Features grouped logically  
✅ **Flexible workflow** - Merge when ready, not before  
✅ **Easy rollback** - Undo specific features without affecting others

## 🌳 Active Reference Branches

### 1. `feature/database-setup` (Commit: 1b5e496)
**Purpose:** PostgreSQL automation and local development setup

**Contents:**
- `scripts/setup-local-db.sh` - Automated database creation
- `scripts/create-postgres-user.sh` - Superuser helper

- `bun.lock` - Package lockfile

**When to merge:**
- Setting up new development environments
- Deploying to new infrastructure
- Need demo data for testing

**How to use:**
```bash
# View what's in the branch
git log feature/database-setup --oneline -5

# Merge entire branch
git checkout main
git merge feature/database-setup --no-edit
git push origin main

git push origin main

# Cherry-pick specific doc
git show docs/testing-documentation:TESTING_GUIDE.md > TESTING_GUIDE.md
git add TESTING_GUIDE.md
git commit -m "docs: add testing guide from reference branch"
```

### 3. `docs/feature-analysis` (Commit: 72cdfd9)
**Purpose:** Feature comparison and implementation roadmap

**Contents:**
- `FEATURE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Missing features with priorities
- `REPOSITORY_COMPARISON.md` - localStorage vs PostgreSQL comparison
- `I18N_DISCOVERY.md` - Multi-language support analysis

**When to merge:**
- Planning feature development
- Comparing with original repository
- Preparing i18n implementation

**How to use:**
```bash
# Read analysis documents
git checkout docs/feature-analysis
cat FEATURE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md

# Merge feature analysis
git checkout main
git merge docs/feature-analysis --no-edit
git push origin main

# Extract specific analysis
git show docs/feature-analysis:I18N_DISCOVERY.md > I18N_DISCOVERY.md
```

---

### 4. `feature/alert-to-toast` (Merged to main ✅)
**Status:** Already merged, can be deleted or kept for reference

**Purpose:** Alert() to toast notification migration

**When to reference:**
- Understanding toast implementation patterns
- Reviewing migration methodology
- Training examples for similar migrations

**How to clean up (optional):**
```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/alert-to-toast

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/alert-to-toast
```

---

## 🔧 Common Operations

### Viewing Branch Contents Without Switching

```bash
# List files in a branch
git ls-tree -r --name-only feature/database-setup

# View specific file from branch
git show docs/testing-documentation:TESTING_GUIDE.md

# Compare branch with main
git diff main..feature/database-setup
```

### Cherry-Picking Specific Changes

```bash
# Cherry-pick a single commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick without committing (review first)
git cherry-pick -n <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick specific file from branch
git checkout feature/database-setup -- scripts/setup-local-db.sh
git commit -m "feat: add database setup script"
```

### Merging Reference Branches Later

```bash
# Merge when ready
git checkout main
git merge feature/database-setup --no-edit
git push origin main

# Merge with squash (single commit)
git merge --squash feature/database-setup
git commit -m "feat: add database setup automation"
git push origin main
```

### Keeping Reference Branches Updated

```bash
# Rebase reference branch on latest main
git checkout feature/database-setup
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/database-setup
```

## 📊 Branch Status Dashboard

| Branch | Status | Commit | Files | Purpose | Merge Ready |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `main` | ✅ Active | 20a9a8b | Production | Main branch | N/A |
| `feature/alert-to-toast` | ✅ Merged | 20a9a8b | 16 files | Toast migration | Merged ✅ |

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### For Day-to-Day Development
1. Work on `main` branch for production features
2. Create new feature branches as needed
3. Keep reference branches untouched unless updating

### When You Need Something from Reference Branches
1. **Option A:** Merge entire branch if you need everything
2. **Option B:** Cherry-pick specific commits if you need parts
3. **Option C:** Copy specific files if you just need reference

### For New Features
```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Optionally incorporate reference branch content
git merge feature/database-setup --no-edit
# OR
git cherry-pick <specific-commit>

# Develop, commit, push
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

## 📝 Branch Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Review reference branches monthly
- [ ] Update branches with main changes if needed
- [ ] Archive branches that are no longer relevant
- [ ] Document any new reference branches created

### Cleanup Strategy
```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Delete merged local branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v "\*\|main" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Delete merged remote branches
git branch -r --merged main | grep -v "\*\|main\|master" | sed 's/origin\///' | xargs -n 1 git push origin --delete
```
